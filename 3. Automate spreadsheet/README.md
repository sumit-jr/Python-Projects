# Automate Spreadsheet with Python

This project aims to demonstrate how to automate spreadsheet tasks using Python. By leveraging the power of Python and its libraries, you can manipulate, analyze, and generate spreadsheets programmatically, saving time and effort.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- `openpyxl` library: Install using `pip install openpyxl`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code:

```
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/automate-spreadsheet.git](https://github.com/sumit-jr/Python-Projects/tree/main/3.%20Automate%20spreadsheet)
```


### Usage

The project provides several examples of automating spreadsheet tasks. You can find them in the `examples` directory. Here's a brief overview of each example:

1. **example1.py**: This example demonstrates how to read data from an existing spreadsheet and perform basic operations like accessing cells, rows, and columns.

2. **example2.py**: In this example, we explore how to write data to a new spreadsheet or modify an existing one. It covers various operations like creating worksheets, writing data to cells, and formatting the spreadsheet.


Remember to update the paths to your spreadsheet files within the example files.
